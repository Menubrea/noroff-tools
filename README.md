# Delivery Code Generator

A simple code generator to match Noroff UI Design delivery syntax. Built using Vite React TypeScript template and Material UI.

## Features

- Stores data in browser memory for convenient use.
- In order from left to right: `Academic Week number`, `Subject Name rendered as shorthand delivery code`, `First name` and `First letter of surname`.

## For the future

- Convert to PWA to run as native.
- Harvard Reference generator.
- Potentially expand to cover more courses.
- Improve on design (currently not a focus).
- Code Refactor.

### PR's welcome.
